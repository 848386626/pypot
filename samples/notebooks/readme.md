# IPython Notebooks everywhere

In the [Poppy Project](https://www.poppy-project.org), we are huge fans of [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) both for development and for documentation. Most of our tests, benchs, experiments, and even debugs are done using notebooks. Thus, we have decided that pypot's documentation and more generally all the software documentation related to the [Poppy Project](https://www.poppy-project.org) in general will move towards notebooks.

We strongly believe that they have an amazing potential 

# Running Notebooks Locally

# Open Source
All the resources content from the Poppy Project is open source. This naturally also extends to the notebooks.
